## TL;DR

We analyze the problem of 3D registration and highlight 2 main problems:
1. Learning-based methods struggle to generalize onto unseen data
2. The current 3D registration benchmark datasets suffer from data variability

What address these problems by:
1. Creating a simple baseline model that outperforms most of the state-of-the-art learning-based methods
3. Creating a novel 3D registration benchmark FAUST-partial based on the FAUST dataset

# Code will be updated soon.
